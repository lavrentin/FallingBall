# Falling Ball

The "Falling Ball" project is a small visualization demonstrating the effect of gravity on circles falling on displey.

## How I created this

1. Create index.html and main.ts.
2. Then I created  (tsc main.ts --outFile main.js), to generate ts file to a js file.

## How it works

1. When the user clicks on the displey, a random ball with a specific radius and color is created.
2. Gravity is applied to each circle, causing them to fall downwards.
3. If a ball touches the bottom boundary of the canvas, it bounces back with a certain coefficient of restitution.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the project in action.
